I‚Äôve got my Ph.D. degree at **[Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences (‰∏≠ÂõΩÁßëÂ≠¶Èô¢Ëá™Âä®ÂåñÁ†îÁ©∂ÊâÄ)](http://english.ia.cas.cn/)** and **[University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (‰∏≠ÂõΩÁßëÂ≠¶Èô¢Â§ßÂ≠¶)](https://english.ucas.ac.cn/)** in Jan. 2024, supervised by **[Prof. Kaiqi Huang (ÈªÑÂáØÂ•á)](https://people.ucas.ac.cn/~huangkaiqi)** (IAPR Fellow). 
I also collaborated with **[Prof. Xin Zhao (ËµµÈë´)](https://www.xinzhaoai.com/)** to conduct research in computer vision.

Before that, I received my master's degree from the **[Department of Computer Science, the University of Hong Kong (HKU)](https://www.cs.hku.hk/)** under the supervision of **[Prof. Choli Wang](https://www.cs.hku.hk/people/academic-staff/clwang)**.

> üì£ I am seeking a PostDoc position starting from Spring 2024. If you are interested in my research or would like to collaborate, please do not hesitate to contact me. You can download my <a href="https://huuuuusy.github.io/files/CV-EN.pdf">CV</a> here.

# ü§ñ Professional Summary

**Excellent Education Background**
- I have obtained my bachelor's, master's, and doctoral degrees from top universities/research institutions in China. The defense results are all excellent.
- I have received multiple awards and honors, and during my doctoral studies, I was awarded the National Scholarship (the highest level of scholarship awarded by the Chinese government, top 0.2%).

**Solid Research Foundation**
- During my doctoral studies, I have published 10 papers, of which 4 are first-author publications -- including top international journals such as **IEEE TPAMI** (IF=23.6), **IJCV** (IF=19.5), top international conference like **NeurIPS**, and a survey in Journal of Images and Graphics (top journal in China).
- The research platform that I am responsible for building and maintaining has received over 287k visits from 130+ countries and regions worldwide.

**Wide Communication and Collaboration**
- I have served as a reviewer for top conferences such as CVPR, AAAI, ACM MM, etc., and will conduct a tutorial at ICIP 2024 (tutorial title: *An Evaluation Perspective in Visual Object Tracking: from Task Design to Benchmark Construction and Algorithm Analysis*).
- Since Sep. 2022, I have initiated and organized interdisciplinary seminars based on computer vision (40+ times, involving 10+ schools and 20+ individuals), covering research areas such as computer vision, cognitive neuroscience, and human-computer interaction.
- I have assisted and supervised nearly 10 bachelor's, master's, and doctoral students in carrying out research work. The research directions have covered visual object tracking, visual language tracking, visual Turing test, and human-computer interaction technology.

# üîçÔ∏è Research Interests

**Visual Object Tracking (VOT)**
- Research on single object tracking algorithms in general scenes and specific scenarios (such as unmanned aerial vehicles).
- Research on the robustness, generalization, and security of single object tracking algorithms.

**Visual Language Tracking (VLT)**
- Research on multi-modal tracking, video understanding, and visual reasoning tasks based on long video sequences.
- Exploring human-computer interaction patterns in long video sequences with visual language tracking as a proxy task.

**Benchmark Construction**
- Research on the construction strategy of single-modal and multi-modal datasets incorporating human knowledge structure.
- Research on designing evaluation mechanism for visual robustness, generalization, and safety.

**Intelligent Evaluation**
- Design of a human-machine universal visual ability evaluation framework.
- Benchmarking the performance of algorithms based on human abilities in perceptual, cognitive, inferential, etc. Analyzing the bottlenecks of algorithms and human subjects in depth, providing guidance for research on human-like modeling, human-machine collaboration, and human-machine integration.

**AIScience**
- *Cognitive Science:* Visual task design, environment construction, and human-machine capability analysis based on human-like modeling principles.
- *Medical Science:* Research on medical image processing techniques based on artificial intelligence technologies (e.g., cell segmentation and tracking, denoising of cryo-electron microscopy images).
- *Psychology:* Development of gamified assessment systems targeting psychological dimensions such as anxiety, depression, and obsession, along with research on intelligent psychological evaluation technologies.

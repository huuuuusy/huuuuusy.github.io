### Hi there, I am Shiyu Hu (胡世宇)!

Currently, I am a Research Fellow at **[Nanyang Technological University (NTU)](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/)**, working with **[Prof. Kanghao Cheong](https://dr.ntu.edu.sg/cris/rp/rp02319)**.
Before that, I got my Ph.D. degree at **[Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences (中国科学院自动化研究所)](http://english.ia.cas.cn/)** and **[University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (中国科学院大学)](https://english.ucas.ac.cn/)** in Jan. 2024, supervised by **[Prof. Kaiqi Huang (黄凯奇)](https://people.ucas.ac.cn/~huangkaiqi)** (IAPR Fellow), co-supervised by **[Prof. Xin Zhao (赵鑫)](https://www.xinzhaoai.com/)**.
I received my master's degree from the **[Department of Computer Science, the University of Hong Kong (HKU)](https://www.cs.hku.hk/)** under the supervision of **[Prof. Choli Wang (王卓立)](https://www.cs.hku.hk/people/academic-staff/clwang)**.

<!-- I strongly hold the belief that ***<font color=DarkRed>the development of artificial intelligence is inherently interconnected with human factors</font>***. Hence, drawing inspiration from the renowned *Turing Test*, my Ph.D research has focused on the concept of *Visual Turing Test*, aiming to integrate human elements into the evaluation of dynamic visual tasks. The ultimate goal of my previous work is to assess and analyze machine vision intelligence by benchmarking against human abilities. I believe that effective evaluation techniques are the foundation for helping us achieve trustworthy and secure artificial general intelligence. 
Please refer to the [🔍️ Research Interests](https://huuuuusy.github.io//#research-interests) for detailed information about my research foundation and ongoing projects. -->

<!-- Besides, I am honored to collaborate with a group of outstanding researchers. We have established the **[Visual Intelligence Interest Group (VIIG)](http://viig.aitestunion.com/)** to promote research in related directions. -->

> 📣 ***<font color=DarkRed>Prof. Cheong's group currently has few vacancies for MPhil. and PhD. Competitive, curious, and self-driven candidates can contact me with your CV.</font>*** 

> 📣 If you are interested in my research direction or hope to cooperate with me, feel free to contact me! Online or offline cooperations are all welcome (shiyu.hu@ntu.edu.sg).

<!-- # 🤖 Professional Summary

**Excellent Education Background**
- I have obtained my bachelor's, master's, and doctoral degrees from top universities/research institutions in China. The defense results are all excellent.
- I have received numerous awards and honors, including the National Scholarship (top 1%, 2023) and Beijing Outstanding Graduates (top 5%, 2024). 

**Solid Research Foundation**
- During my doctoral studies, I have published 14 papers, of which 5 are first-author/corresponding author publications -- including 3 papers in IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence ***<font color=DarkRed>(IEEE TPAMI, Top-1 Journal in computer vision, CCF-A journal)</font>*** and International Journal of Computer Vision ***<font color=DarkRed>(IJCV, Top-2 Journal in computer vision, CCF-A journal)</font>***, 1 paper in the 37th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems ***<font color=DarkRed>(NeurIPS, Top AI conferences in Google Scholar, CCF-A conference)</font>***, and a survey in Journal of Images and Graphics (top journal in China). Besides, invited by Springer, I will complete a book in Dec. 2024 (title: *Visual Object Tracking - An Evaluation Perspective*).
- The research platform that I am responsible for building and maintaining has received over 382k visits from 130+ countries and regions worldwide.

**Wide Communication and Collaboration**
- I have served as a reviewer for top conferences and journals such as CVPR, ECCV, AAAI, ACMMM, SCIENCE CHINA Information Sciences, etc., and will conduct a tutorial at ICIP conference in Oct. 2024 (tutorial title: *An Evaluation Perspective in Visual Object Tracking: from Task Design to Benchmark Construction and Algorithm Analysis*).
- Since Sep. 2022, I have initiated and organized interdisciplinary seminars based on computer vision (40+ times, involving 10+ schools and 20+ individuals), covering research areas such as computer vision, cognitive neuroscience, and human-computer interaction.
- I have assisted and supervised nearly 10 bachelor's, master's, and doctoral students in carrying out research work. Besides, I have established the [Visual Intelligence Interest Group (VIIG)](http://viig.aitestunion.com/) and work with these students to promote research in related directions (e.g., visual object tracking, visual language tracking, visual Turing test, and human-computer interaction technology). -->

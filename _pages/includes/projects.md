**Darknet-Cross: Light-weight Deep Learning Framework for Heterogeneous Computing**<br>
- [Darknet-Cross](https://github.com/huuuuusy/Darknet-Cross) is a lightweight deep learning framework, mainly based on the open-source deep learning algorithm library Darknet and yolov2_light, and it has been successfully ported to mobile devices through cross-compilation. This framework enables efficient algorithm inference using mobile GPUs.
- Darknet-Cross supports algorithm acceleration processing on various platforms (e.g., Android and Ubuntu) and various GPUs (e.g., Nvidia GTX1070 and Adreno 630).
- The work is a part of my master's thesis at the University of Hong Kong (thesis defense grade: A+).

My research has long focused on **evaluating and modeling machine vision intelligence**, covering task modeling, environment construction, evaluation techniques, and human–machine comparisons. I firmly believe that ***<font color=DarkRed>the development of artificial intelligence is inherently intertwined with human factors</font>***. Inspired by the classical ***<font color=DarkRed>Turing Test</font>***, I have extended this concept to visual understanding, proposing the ***<font color=DarkRed>Visual Turing Test</font>*** as a human-centered framework for evaluating dynamic vision tasks. The overarching goal is to benchmark machine visual intelligence against human abilities, building **trustworthy and explainable evaluation systems** that advance us toward secure and reliable Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).

### 1️⃣ What abilities define human perception? Designing more human-like visual tasks

I take **Visual Object Tracking (VOT)** as a representative task to explore the boundaries of machine dynamic visual ability. Traditional VOT is limited by its assumption of continuous motion, which fails to align with human cognitive tracking capabilities. To overcome this, I proposed ***<font color=DarkRed>Global Instance Tracking (GIT)</font>*** — a humanoid-inspired reformulation that shifts tracking from a short-term perceptual level to a long-term **cognitive level**. Building on this, I introduced ***<font color=DarkRed>Multi-modal GIT (MGIT)</font>*** by incorporating hierarchical semantic structures, enabling machines to perform **visual reasoning** over complex spatio-temporal causal relationships. Together, these extensions mark a transition from perceptual recognition to cognitive understanding.

### 2️⃣ What environments do humans perceive? Constructing more open and realistic visual spaces

Human environments are dynamic, continuous, and semantically rich, yet most datasets remain static and task-limited. To address this, I developed the ***[VideoCube](http://videocube.aitestunion.com/)*** benchmark by integrating **narrative theory** to decompose video content into interpretable units. Building further, I proposed ***[SOTVerse](https://huuuuusy.github.io/#SOTVerse)***, a large-scale and open **task space** (12.56M frames) that enables flexible subspace generation for evaluating **visual generalization** across diverse conditions. To tackle visual robustness in real-world dynamics, I further developed ***[BioDrone](https://huuuuusy.github.io/#BioDrone)*** — the first bio-inspired flapping-wing drone benchmark — providing a novel testing ground for **robust visual intelligence** under motion perturbations and environmental challenges.

### 3️⃣ How large is the human–machine gap? Benchmarking machine vision against human ability

While computer scientists evaluate models on large datasets and neuroscientists assess humans in controlled experiments, this disciplinary gap prevents unified human–machine evaluation. To bridge this, I constructed a unified evaluation environment based on SOTVerse, enabling **direct human–machine comparisons** in perception, cognition, and robustness. Results reveal that recent algorithms are closing the gap with human subjects, with humans excelling in semantic understanding and machines in precision and persistence. This complementary behavior suggests the emerging potential for ***<font color=DarkRed>human–machine collaborative intelligence</font>*** in dynamic vision.

This human-centered evaluation paradigm is formalized as the ***<font color=DarkRed>3E Framework</font>*** — **Environment**, **Evaluation**, and **Executors** — forming a closed loop that defines, measures, and evolves intelligent behavior. Machines acquire human-like abilities by iteratively performing humanoid proxy tasks within evolving environments and evaluation criteria. Through this iterative mechanism, their cognitive upper bounds are continuously improved, laying the foundation for building **evaluative, explainable, and human-aligned intelligence**.

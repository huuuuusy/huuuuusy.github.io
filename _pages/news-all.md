**2025.05**: 📝One [review paper](https://huuuuusy.github.io/#CEAI-adaptive) has been accepted by Computers and Education: Artificial Intelligence. 

**2025.05**: 📣Our new work [FIOVA](https://huuuuusy.github.io/#FIOVA) is now online! We introduce a multi-annotator benchmark for human-aligned video captioning, supporting semantic diversity and cognitive-aware evaluation. Check out the [project page](https://huuuuusy.github.io/fiova/) and [arXiv paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.15270) for more details.

**2025.05**: 📣Our updated work [SOEI](https://huuuuusy.github.io/#SOEI) now available! Building upon our previous framework, this version introduces interactive multi-turn simulation to model open-ended educational dialogues with cognitively plausible virtual students. We further validate the framework's effectiveness through behavioral analysis, personality recognition, and teacher-student reflection. Read more in the[arXiv paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.15701).

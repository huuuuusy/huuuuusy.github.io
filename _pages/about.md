I’m currently working for my Ph.D. degree at **[Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences](http://www.ia.cas.cn/)**, supervised by **[Prof. Kaiqi Huang](https://people.ucas.ac.cn/~huangkaiqi)**. Before that, I received my master's degree from the **[Department of Computer Science, the University of Hong Kong](https://www.cs.hku.hk/)** under the supervision of **[Prof. Choli Wang](https://www.cs.hku.hk/people/academic-staff/clwang)**.
I’m currently learning **computer vision**, **visual object tracking** and **cognitive neuroscience**.

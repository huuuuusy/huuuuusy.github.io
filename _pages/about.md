<!-- I’ve got my Ph.D. degree at **[Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CASIA)](http://english.ia.cas.cn/)** and **[University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (UCAS)](https://english.ucas.ac.cn/)** in Jan. 2024, supervised by **[Prof. Kaiqi Huang](https://people.ucas.ac.cn/~huangkaiqi)** (IAPR Fellow). Before that, I received my master's degree from the **[Department of Computer Science, the University of Hong Kong (HKU)](https://www.cs.hku.hk/)** under the supervision of **[Prof. Choli Wang](https://www.cs.hku.hk/people/academic-staff/clwang)**.
I’m currently learning **computer vision**, **visual object tracking** and **AI4Science**. -->

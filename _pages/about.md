# üîçÔ∏è Research Interests

**Visual Object Tracking (VOT)**
- Research on single object tracking algorithms in general scenes and specific scenarios (such as unmanned aerial vehicles).
- Research on the robustness, generalization, and security of single object tracking algorithms.

**Visual Language Tracking (VLT)**
- Research on multi-modal tracking, video understanding, and visual reasoning tasks based on long video sequences.
- Exploring human-computer interaction patterns in long video sequences with visual language tracking as a proxy task.

**Benchmark Construction**
- Research on the construction strategy of single-modal and multi-modal datasets incorporating human knowledge structure.
- Research on designing evaluation mechanism for visual robustness, generalization, and safety.

**Intelligent Evaluation**
- Design of a human-machine universal visual ability evaluation framework.
- Benchmarking the performance of algorithms based on human abilities in perceptual, cognitive, inferential, etc. Analyzing the bottlenecks of algorithms and human subjects in depth, providing guidance for research on human-like modeling, human-machine collaboration, and human-machine integration.

**AI4Science**
- **Cognitive Science:** Visual task design, environment construction, and human-machine capability analysis based on human-like modeling principles.
- **Medical Science:** Research on medical image processing techniques based on artificial intelligence technologies (e.g., cell segmentation and tracking, denoising of cryo-electron microscopy images).
- **Psychology:** Development of gamified assessment systems targeting psychological dimensions such as anxiety, depression, and obsession, along with research on intelligent psychological evaluation technologies.
